Simple Names App that I built to practice basic Flask.
Enter any name in the browser search bar and find out its gender and popularity in the USA.

To run the app after cloning (you need to have Python and Flask already installed), cd into the folder with it and type these in your terminal to start the server:

export FLASK_APP=server.py
flask run
